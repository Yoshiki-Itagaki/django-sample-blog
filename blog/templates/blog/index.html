                                There's nothing like the views you get when hiking in the 
                                mountains! And I wasn't even prepared for what would happen whilst 
                                I was enjoying the view!

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p> I love programming. I love to help others and I enjoy exploring new technologies!</p>
        <p> 
            My goal is to keep on growing as a developer - and if I could help you do the same, 
            I'd be quite happy!
